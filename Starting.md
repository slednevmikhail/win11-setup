## Step 1: Installing Windows <br>
[Windows 11 Installation Guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ways-to-install-windows-11-e0edbbfb-cfc5-4011-868b-2ce77ac7c70e) <br>

## Step 2: Activation - 
[Microsoft Activation Script (Recommended)](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts)
> Open-source Windows and Office activator featuring HWID, Ohook, TSforge, KMS38, and Online KMS activation methods, along with advanced troubleshooting.
## Step 3: Debloat <br>
I don't really recommend using Chris Titus Tech's winutil or stuff like UWT, O&O and other, because 
it can easily break something, and if you dont really know what you are doing DO NOT try to use it, even with guides.
Instead we will use less complicated stuff and make small safe changes, just to have more control over things and keep everything stable. <br>

[Win11Debloat](https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat) <br>
> Win11Debloat is a simple, easy to use and lightweight PowerShell script that can remove pre-installed Windows bloatware apps, disable telemetry and declutter the experience by disabling or removing intrusive interface elements, ads and more. No need to painstakingly go through all the settings yourself or remove apps one by one. Win11Debloat makes the process quick and easy!

Use "default" mode. <br>
Then go to settings -> installed apps and uninstall things like dev hove, cortana and power automate. **DO NOT UNINSTALL OUTLOOK**

First you need to disable outlook, just open Outlook app and disable everything related to storage. Then you can delete it

## Step 4: Customization <br>
[StartAllBack](https://www.startallback.com/)
> StartAllBack is focuses on reverting aspects of the Windows 11 Start Menu and taskbar to a more familiar style, such as that of Windows 10 or even Windows 7. 

Makes taskbar, "home" button and context menu act like in windows 10
